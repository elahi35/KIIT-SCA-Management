# KIIT-SCA-Management
KIIT SCHOOL OF COMPUTER APPLICATION MANAGEMENT
The project KSCA Management with social media was developed mainly for college management and to prevent addiction to external social media apps of college students, I created a social media platform with it. It has a post, like, comment, share, chatting / messenger etc features. This paper proposes a system for student management that utilizes social media platforms to improve communication and collaboration between students, and teachers. The proposed system takes advantage of the ubiquity and popularity of social media to streamline various administrative and academic tasks, such as attendance tracking, assignment submission, and grade reporting. The system also integrates features for promoting student engagement, such as online discussion forums and peer-to-peer communication channels. The use of social media in student management has the potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and community-building, thereby improving the overall educational experience for all stakeholders.
